 * Shared session lifecycle for the visible-editing tools.
 *
 * The families (docs / slides / sheets) each open a real tab and drive it
 * through their own bridge, but the *lifecycle* is identical: open a blank tab,
 * edit it, save it to a path, end the session. Registering one pair of
 * create_session / save_session tools instead of six near-identical ones keeps
 * the tool list the agent sees small, while each family module keeps owning its
 * own tab + editor protocol behind a FamilyDriver.
 *
 * Family ids, labels and the saveable extensions all come from the format
 * registry (./formats) so this surface tracks the editor instead of drifting
 * from it. One session is active at a time: creating a new session replaces the
 * previous one, so the content tools always address an unambiguous target.
